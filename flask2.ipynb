    "\n",
    "\n",
    "GET and POST are two of the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) methods used for communication between a client (such as a web browser) and a server. These methods define the action the client wants to perform on a specified resource (like a web page or a data resource). Here's an explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "GET Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: The GET method is used to request data from a specified resource.\n",
    "Data Transmission: Data is appended to the URL in the form of parameters. This makes it visible in the browser's address bar, and the amount of data that can be sent is limited.\n",
    "Idempotent: GET requests are considered idempotent, meaning that making the same request multiple times will produce the same result. They are safe in the sense that they should not have any side effects on the server."

    "Purpose: The POST method is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource.\n",

    "Security: POST requests are more secure than GET requests for sensitive data because the data is not visible in the URL.\n",
